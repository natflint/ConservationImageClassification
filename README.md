# Classifying Animals in Convservation Park Using Deep Learning Methods
The introduction of trap cameras to wildlife conservationist activities has allowed for conservationists to track animals in their natural habitats, while leaving them undisturbed. In this study we will attempt to build an image classification pipeline using deep learning neural networks to classify images taken on trap camera images in the rainforest of Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. However, through the development and investigation of our deep learning model with Grad-CAMs, we discovered that the images are too much background noise from the images’ environment to successfully extract the features needed to classify these animals.![image](https://github.com/natflint/ConservationImageClassification/assets/115076736/0138975f-57c8-42fd-a805-fddb6e526e57)
